1. State and Explain the components of a DBMS(Database Management System)
Hardware,This includes the physical components like servers, storage devices (hard drives, SSDs), and network infrastructure that store and process the database data.   
Software,This is the core of the DBMS, comprising the software programs that manage the database
Data,This is the actual information stored within the database, organized in tables, rows, and columns.   
Procedures,These are pre-defined sets of instructions that automate common database tasks, such as data entry, updates, and reporting.   
Database Access Language,This is the language used to interact with the database, such as SQL (Structured Query Language)


2. What is a relational database? Give 4 examples.
A database organized using a table-based structure, where data is represented in rows and columns
Examples
Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System: Stores customer information, interactions, and purchase history.   
Inventory Management System: Tracks products in stock, orders, and suppliers.   
Financial Accounting System: Manages accounts, transactions, and financial reports.   
E-commerce Platform: Stores product information, customer details, orders, and payment data.

3. State and Explain three classifications of SQL?
Data Definition Language,Used to define the structure of the database, including creating, modifying, and deleting tables, indexes, and views. Examples,CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, DROP TABLE.   
Data Manipulation Language,Used to manipulate the data within the database, such as inserting, updating, and deleting records. Examples,INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, SELECT.   
Data Control Language,Used to control access to the database, including granting and revoking user privileges. Examples,GRANT, REVOKE

4. What is the difference between a Primary Key and a Foreign Key?
Primary Key is a unique identifier for each row in a table. 
Foreign Key links between tables that connects related data therefore establishes a relationship between the two tables

5. What is an Entity-Relationship Diagram?
Is a graphical representation of the entities within a database and the relationships between them. It helps in the design and understanding of the database structure.

6. What are the advantages of relational databases?
Data Independence: Changes to the data structure do not affect the applications that access the data.
Data Integrity: Ensures data consistency and accuracy through constraints like primary keys and foreign keys.
Data Security: Provides mechanisms for controlling access to data and preventing unauthorized modifications.   
Flexibility: Easily adaptable to changing business requirements.
Scalability: Can handle large volumes of data and support a growing number of users.

7. State four types of data type used to store data in tables?
Integer (INT): Stores whole numbers.
Character (CHAR/VARCHAR): Stores text data.
Date/Time (DATE, TIME, TIMESTAMP): Stores dates and times.
Decimal/Numeric: Stores numbers with decimal places.

8. What is the purpose of a database management system (DBMS)? 
Store and retrieve data: Create, read, update, and delete data in a structured manner.   
Ensure data integrity: Maintain data accuracy, consistency, and validity.
Control data access: Grant or restrict access to data based on user roles and permissions.
Improve data security: Protect data from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion.   
Support multiple users: Allow concurrent access to the database by multiple users without data conflicts.   
Provide data recovery: Enable the recovery of data in case of system failures or data loss.
